The Veneer Marketplace project is an interactive command line program that allows a user to do the following:
    1. Add clients to a "database"
    2. Add items (in this case, works of art) to the "database"
    3. List works of art as "for sale" on the marketplace
    4. Change the owner (sell) a work of art
    5. View everything currently in the database

The program utilizes class definitions to track the artworks and clients. To run, simply download the code from veneer.py and run it on the command line.
